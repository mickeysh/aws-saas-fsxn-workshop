Congratulations! Now that you've finished this workshop you should have a good working knowledge on how to implement and solve different storage and data management challanges in your own SaaS environment running on EKS. 

If you'd like to extend you knowledge even more you have a look at the [addtional resources](addtional-resources). There you'll find some technical blogs with some more hands-on practice, workshops and important documenation.

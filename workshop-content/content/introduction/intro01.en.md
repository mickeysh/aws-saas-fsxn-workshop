Application developers and cloud architects that are looking to get into the details of implementing a SaaS solution on AWS are encouraged to participate. The content of the workshop is geared toward those familiar with EKS, FSxN and SaaS concepts. However, even if you don't have a background in these, this experience could still expose you to specifics of delivering a stateful SaaS service on AWS with EKS and FSxN.

We don't spend a lot of time teaching foundational FSxN and EKS concepts in this workshop, and expect you to have some working knowledge here. If you haven't already done so, we encourage all participants to complete at least the beginners portion of the [extremely valuable, AWS EKSWorkshop](https://www.eksworkshop.com) and spesifically the [FSxN module in the Storage section](https://www.eksworkshop.com/docs/fundamentals/storage/fsx-for-netapp-ontap/).
